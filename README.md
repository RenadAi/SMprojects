Task 3  Move Arm  by  Speech 

The third task in training is Programming a web page to control the arm using the web serial API

A serial port is a bidirectional communication interface that allows sending and receiving data byte by byte.

The Web Serial API provides a way for websites to read from and write to a serial device with JavaScript. Serial devices are connected either through a serial port on the user's system or through removable USB and Bluetooth devices that emulate a serial port.

To learn more about it, read the following:

The fourth task in the training is to Write the Arduino code for the control.
